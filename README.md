## 🚀 Introduction

**Welcome to the Malware Analysis project!** This repository offers a comprehensive analysis, essential tools, and detailed reports on a specific malware campaign. Our objective is to shed light on the campaign's methodologies, tactics, and impact, alongside providing effective tools for detection and prevention. The malware is a skeleton frame of malvertising, which has a very large and ephemeral footprint.
